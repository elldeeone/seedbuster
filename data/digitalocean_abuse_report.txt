EVIDENCE
--------

1. The phishing domain kaspa-wallet.co contains JavaScript that:
   - Sends victim seed phrases to whale-app-poxe2.ondigitalocean.app
   - Logs visitor IPs to walrus-app-o5hvw.ondigitalocean.app
   - Uses ipdata.co API for geolocation (key: 520a83d66268292f5b97ca64c496ef3b9cfb1bb1f85f2615b103f66f)

2. API probing confirmed the backend accepts seed phrase submissions:
   Response from /api/form/text:
   {"status":false,"message":"appName and seedPhrase are required"}

   Response from /api/form/submit:
   {"status":false,"message":"Validation error","details":["Info is required",
   "App Name is required","Valid URL is required","Referer is required",
   "Country is required","Country emoji is required","City is required",
   "Valid IP address is required","User agent is required"]}

3. Stack disclosure confirms Express.js backend:
   - X-Powered-By: Express
   - Error messages leak source path: /app/index.js:341:18

DATA COLLECTED BY SCAMMER
-------------------------
Per the API schema, the scammer collects:
- Cryptocurrency seed phrases (12/24 word recovery phrases)
- Victim IP addresses
- Geolocation (country, city)
- Browser user agent
- Referrer URL
- Target wallet app name

IMPACT
------
Cryptocurrency seed phrases provide complete control over victims' wallets.
This infrastructure enables theft of cryptocurrency funds with no recourse
for victims once phrases are compromised.

REQUESTED ACTION
----------------
Please immediately suspend/terminate both App Platform applications:
- whale-app-poxe2
- walrus-app-o5hvw

And preserve any logs that may help identify the account holder for
potential law enforcement referral.
